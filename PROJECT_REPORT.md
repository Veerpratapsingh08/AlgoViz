# AlgoViz Project Report

## What is AlgoViz?
**AlgoViz** is a minimalist, modern Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to make algorithms and data structures intuitive and visible.
It replaces complex textbook descriptions with calm, step-by-step 2D visualizations that focus on clarity over spectacle.
The application is accessible across all modern browsers and devices, providing a distraction-free environment for learning core computer science concepts.

## What You Get?

**AlgoViz** provides instant availability to interactive visualizations for Sorting, Pathfinding, and Data Structures.

*   **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizes comparisons and swaps for Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap sort.
*   **Pathfinding**: Demonstrates exploration and shortest path finding with Dijkstra, A*, BFS, and DFS.
*   **Data Structures**: Interactive playgrounds for Binary Search Trees, Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists.
*   **Clean Design**: intentionally restrained UI with semantic colors and slow motion to maximize readability.
*   **No Noise**: Zero gamification or unnecessary visual clutter—just pure logic unfolding.

## Built With :-

*   **Next.js** – React Framework for production-grade web applications.
*   **React** – Library for building interactive user interfaces.
*   **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive styling.
*   **TypeScript** – For type-safe, robust code.
*   **Vercel** – Global deployment and hosting platform.

## Industry Uses :-

**Computer Science Education**
Used by students and self-learners to build a mental model of abstract algorithms.

**Technical Interview Preparation**
Helps candidates visualize and internalize the mechanics of common interview problems.

**Teaching Aids**
Serves as a dynamic whiteboard for instructors to demonstrate algorithm behaviors in real-time.

## Future Scope:-

**Code Export**
The system can be expanded to generate implementation code in Python, Java, and C++ for the visualized algorithm.

**Custom Algorithm Builder**
Allow users to define their own steps or logic and visualize custom algorithms.

**User Accounts & Progress**
Save preferred settings, custom visualizations, and track learning progress.

**Performance Mode**
A mode to compare the execution speed and efficiency of different algorithms side-by-side with larger datasets.
