# AlgoViz

AlgoViz is a minimalist algorithm visualizer built to make **thinking visible**.

It focuses on clarity over spectacle, using calm motion and restrained design
to explore sorting algorithms, pathfinding techniques, and fundamental data
structures.

No gamification.
No visual noise.
Just logic, unfolding step by step.

## What it does

### Sorting Algorithms

Visualizes how data is ordered over time, with emphasis on comparisons,
swaps, and progression.

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort

### Pathfinding

Shows how different algorithms explore space and arrive at a solution.

* Dijkstra’s Algorithm
* A* Search
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search

Users can draw walls, move start and end nodes, and observe exploration
and path reconstruction.

### Data Structures

Interactive representations of core structures:

* Binary Search Tree
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked List

Insert and remove operations are visualized to emphasize structure and flow.

## Design philosophy

AlgoViz is intentionally restrained.

Motion is slowed to remain readable.
Colors are semantic, not decorative.
Structure is prioritized over novelty.

The goal is not to impress, but to **explain**.

## Tech stack

* Next.js
* React
* HTML / CSS
* JavaScript

Algorithms are kept separate from UI logic to preserve clarity and reuse.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Veerpratapsingh08/algoviz.git

npm install
npm run dev
```
