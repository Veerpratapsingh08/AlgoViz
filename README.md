# AlgoViz

A minimalist algorithm visualizer focused on clarity, structure, and
intentional motion.

AlgoViz explores sorting algorithms, pathfinding techniques, and core
data structures through calm, readable visualizations — without
gamification or visual noise.

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Real-time visualization of comparisons, swaps, execution flow,
and time complexity.

### Pathfinding Algorithms
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- A* Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search

Interactive grid with wall drawing, start/end nodes,
and animated exploration.

### Data Structures
- Binary Search Tree
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List

Insert and remove operations with structural visualization.

## Design Philosophy

AlgoViz is designed with restraint.

The goal is not to entertain, but to **reveal how algorithms think**.
Motion is slow enough to follow.
Colors are semantic, not decorative.
Every interaction has a reason.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks. No dependencies.
